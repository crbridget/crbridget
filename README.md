## Featured Projects

**Codescape** | VS Code Extension & Web Visualization (Coming Soon)
- Developer tool that transforms codebases into evolving 3D city visualizations where classes become buildings, functions add floors, and project architecture becomes explorable
- VS Code extension with Tree-sitter parsing, live WebView rendering, and JSON export functionality for sharing GitHub-hosted visualizations
- Built to solve the accountability gap in personal projects by making invisible coding progress tangible and shareable

**CoopScout** | Full-Stack Automation Platform
- Python/Selenium web scraper with cookie-based authentication extracting 1000+ co-op postings from NUworks
- Flask REST API with Supabase PostgreSQL integration and content-based recommendation system using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity
- Built to democratize access to co-op hiring insights through structured data collection and automated matching

**sportsnetsci** | Network Science & Sports Analytics
- Directed network analysis framework processing 1,500+ soccer possession sequences from StatsBomb event data
- Implements graph-based classification using centrality metrics, path analysis, and motif detection to identify tactical signatures
- Applies Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi tessellation for spatial analysis of On-Ball Value flow

**Superfoods or Super Marketing?** | Machine Learning Analysis
- Data acquisition pipeline using USDA API collecting 2000+ food profiles with 13 nutrition label features
- Trained NumPy perceptron and sklearn SGDClassifier models achieving 96.8% accuracy with perfect precision
- Applied confusion matrices and convergence analysis to distinguish nutritional patterns from marketing claims
